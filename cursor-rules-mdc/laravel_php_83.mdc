2. Coding Standards and Conventions:
  
  - File names: Use kebab-case (e.g., my-class-file.php)

  - Method names: Use camelCase (e.g., myMethod)
  - Variable and Properties names: Use snake_case (e.g., my_variable)
  - Constants and Enum Cases names: Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MY_CONSTANT)

3. Package Structure and File Organization:

  - Describe the purpose of each main directory and key files
  - Explain how the package will be integrated into a Laravel application
